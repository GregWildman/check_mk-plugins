description:
 Checks temperatures of a MikroTik RouterOS device.

 This check reports temperatures for chassis and cpu. If given by
 device, it honors overtemperature value for cpu as {CRIT}. Upper
 and lower thresholds for {WARN} and {CRIT} can be configured by
 WATO.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information). You can find it under the
 name {Check MikroTik RouterOS via API} in Wato -> Datasource Programs.
