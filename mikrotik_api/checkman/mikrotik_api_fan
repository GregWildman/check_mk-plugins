description:
 Checks fans of a MikroTik RouterOS device.

 This check reports rpm of the fans of the device. Upper
 and lower thresholds for {WARN} and {CRIT} can be configured by
 WATO.

 {HINT}: mikrotik api might return non-existing fans with speed 0,
 which results in critical services on inventory.
 There is no known way to detect this, so just disable those services.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information). You can find it under the
 name {Check MikroTik RouterOS via API} in Wato -> Datasource Programs.
