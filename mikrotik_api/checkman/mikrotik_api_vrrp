 Checks VRRP of a MikroTik Router

 This check will be {OK} if an VRRP instance is in state "running"
 on a master node or "not running" on a backup node.
 It will report {WARN} if disabled and {CRIT} in any other case.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information). You can find it under the
 name {Check MikroTik RouterOS via API} in Wato -> Datasource Programs.

 One service per VRRP instance of the device.
