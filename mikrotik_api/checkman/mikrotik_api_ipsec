description:
 Checks IPsec of a MikroTik Router

 This check reports status of ipsec connections. I will go
 {WARN} if number of sa is changing and {CRIT} if number of sa
 is odd or 0. sa states not 'mature' or 'dying' will go {CRIT}.
 It stays {OK} if an ipsec has no sa, but local IP address is
 invalid. This usually is a standby gateway.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information). You can find it under the
 name {Check MikroTik RouterOS via API} in Wato -> Datasource Programs.
