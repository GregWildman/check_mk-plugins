description:
 Firewall Filter rules of a MikroTik Router

 This check reports bandwidth and packets/sec of a firewall
 filter rule, it's disabled state and rule id. It will go
 {WARN} if disabled state changes after discovery.
 The comment of a rule is the identifying item and part of the service
 name. You may shorten this by using a keyword in comment: everything
 after "checkmk: " is used as item if keyword is found.

 To connect to the MikroTik device a special datasource program is
 used (SNMP won't report this information). You can find it under the
 name {Check MikroTik RouterOS via API} in Wato -> Datasource Programs.

item:
 comment of rule, shortened if applicable.

perfdata:
 bit/s and packet/s

inventory:
 one service per commented rule
