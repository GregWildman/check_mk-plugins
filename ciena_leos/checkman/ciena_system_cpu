title: Ciena LEOS/SAOS: CPU load average
catalog: unsorted
agents: snmp

description:
 This check measures the CPU load average via SNMP.

 The device sends a 1, 5 and 15 minute average of the CPU load.
 The 15 minute value is checked against a warning and a critical level.
 Since the SNMP MIB does not contain information about the number
 of CPUs this check assumes only one CPU to be present. Thatfore
 the warn/crit levels are interpreted as {absolute} values - not
 as values {per cpu}.

inventory:
 One service will be created for each device.
